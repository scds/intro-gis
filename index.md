# Introduction to GIS

This beginner workshop introduces the core concepts of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial data. Through the use of the GIS software program, [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/), hands-on exercises will incorporate these concepts in the creation of a map. 

For the required software and data downloads, go to the [Preparation](https://scds.github.io/intro-gis/preparation.html) page.
